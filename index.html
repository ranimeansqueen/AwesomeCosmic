      <div class="image-text">Black holes are like invisible cosmic vacuum cleaners—so strong, not even light can escape their pull!

If you got too close, you'd be stretched like spaghetti in a process scientists call spaghettification </div>

     <div class="image-text">gamma-ray bursts are the universe’s biggest explosions—so powerful, they can outshine entire galaxies for a few seconds!

They come from dying stars collapsing or neutron stars smashing into each other</div>

     <div class="image-text">When two ultra-dense neutron stars crash, they release shockwaves and heavy elements—like gold and platinum—into space!

The collision creates ripples in spacetime itself, called gravitational waves, which we can actually detect on Earth </div>

     <div class="image-text">A supernova is a dying star going out with a bang—bright enough to be seen across the galaxy.

It blasts out all the elements we’re made of—carbon, oxygen, iron—so you could say we’re made of stardust</div>
